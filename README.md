In this project, I simulated a Wireshark Incident Report as part of my IT Auditing and Cybersecurity Analytics course. On February 8, 2024, I detected suspicious activities from the host DESKTOP-MGVG60Z (IP: 10.2.8.101) linked to the Windows user "bill.cook." By analyzing packet data, I identified communications with external IPs, including known Command and Control (C2) servers, and noted attempts to download harmful executables. This exercise highlighted the importance of network monitoring and the effectiveness of Wireshark in identifying security threats.

Through this mock audit, I applied key principles of network forensics, demonstrating my ability to analyze packet data for indicators of compromise. I assessed vulnerabilities related to malicious files on roanokemortgages.com and their associated network registrations. This project enhanced my skills in incident detection and response, aligning with the course objectives of understanding cybersecurity frameworks and practical auditing techniques.
